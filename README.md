## Requirements

- Install Node
    - on OSX install [home brew](http://brew.sh/) and type `brew install node`
    - on Windows install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) and type `choco install nodejs`
- On OSX you can alleviate the need to run as sudo by [following these instructions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md). I highly recommend this step on OSX
- Open terminal
- Type `npm install -g node-inspector bower gulp`

## Installing Node.js and Bower Packages
- Open terminal
- Type `npm install`

## Installing Bower Packages
`npm install` will install these too, but you can do it manually.
- Open terminal
- Type `bower install`

## Running
Runs locally, no database required.
